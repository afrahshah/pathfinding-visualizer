# Pathfinding Visualizer

A React-based application for visualizing pathfinding algorithms on a grid. This project demonstrates different pathfinding techniques, including Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS), with real-time animations of node traversal and shortest path determination.

## Features

1.  Algorithm Visualization: Visualize Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, BFS, and DFS with real-time            animations.
2.  Dynamic Node Placement: Place start and end nodes anywhere on the grid.
3.  Interactive Grid: Add or remove walls dynamically using mouse interactions.
4.  Reset Functionality: Clear the grid and start fresh with a reset button.
5.  Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
